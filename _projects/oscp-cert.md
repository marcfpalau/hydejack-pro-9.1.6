Hello cyber enthusiasts and aspiring ethical hackers! Today, I'm excited to share my incredible journey towards becoming an Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) and my review of this highly known certification.

## The exam
While the exam may initially appear daunting due to its extended duration (48 hours, with 24 dedicated to hacking and 24 for reporting), once you have a solid grasp of the concepts, it resembles any other penetration test you've encountered before. Don't allow the proctoring process or the time constraints to cause unnecessary concern. Effective time management and taking periodic breaks are the essential factors for success.
## Is it worth it?
The Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification is definitely worth it because it equips you with practical, hands-on skills in penetration testing and ethical hacking. Also it's highly recognized in the cybersecurity industry, opening doors to job opportunities and demonstrating your commitment to cybersecurity. Also being able to demonstrate you can pass a demanding evaluation system is a plus soft skill.
## My Journey
During my OSCP preparation, I made a full-time commitment over the course of seven intense months. I began by covering the theory materials and completing exercises on the OffSec platform, establishing a strong foundational knowledge.

To refine my practical skills, I dedicated considerable time pwning numerous machines on Hack The Box (HTB). This hands-on experience allowed me to hone my skillset, enabling me to identify vulnerabilities and exploit them effectively.

The OSCP labs on the OffSec platform marked a critical phase in my journey. On the last 2 months I immersed myself in these labs, tackling increasingly complex challenges. This dedicated effort was instrumental in preparing me for the demanding OSCP exam, ensuring I had the practical expertise needed to succeed in real-world scenarios.

This is what worked for me. Before starting, my knowledge base was small and I learned a lot during this preparation. Your preparation may be shorter if your knowledge is wider, OSCP is very self-paced. There is no such magical formula.
## My Review of the OSCP
In retrospect, the OSCP is undoubtedly one of the most valuable certifications in the field of cybersecurity. Here are some key takeaways from my journey:

1. Practice pwning machines: The more varied attack vectors you encounter, the broader your skill set becomes, enhancing your capabilities as a hacker. Perfect your abilities by practicing the exploitation of different types of machines.
2. Take detailed notes: Documenting your procedures and essential attack commands is a game-changer. I experienced a significant improvement in my ability and efficiency when I began keeping detailed notes. Personally, I found markdown note-taking with Obsidian to be a crucial aid. Trust me, even if you never took notes in university, they are essential here!
3. Engage with the community: The OSCP community is vast and supportive. There are countless forums, blogs, and chat rooms where you can connect with others on the same journey, seek help, and share your experiences, I recommend the OSCP discord included with your course purchase.
4. Learn alternatives to different tools:  In the world of penetration testing, versatility is key. Different situations may require different tools. For instance, while Linux tools might suffice for some Active Directory attacks, there are instances where specialized tools like Rubeus are indispensable. When it comes to pivoting, you may need to consider alternatives if standard methods like SSH tunneling or Chisel aren't viable. Be open to exploring a variety of tools and techniques.
5. Perseverance: The OSCP journey is challenging, and you'll face setbacks. I have found myself many times where I thought I wasnt going to make it and that pentesting was not my strong skill. But the journey often feels like this:

## Conclusion
My OSCP journey was an intense adventure filled with challenges, small triumphs, and a lot autonomous learning. It not only sharpened my technical skills to a new level but also taught me the importance of determination and perseverance.
If you're considering taking the OSCP, my advice is to go for it. Embrace the journey, dive into the labs, and push your limits. It's a transformative experience that will set you on a path to becoming a highly skilled penetration tester. Good luck in your OSCP journey, and may you have as much fun as I did!

Happy hacking, and may your shells be ever fruitful! üêöüíªüîì
