  summary: >
    My interests in terms of the professional career I want to develop are oriented towards networks and
    computer systems, that's why I'm studying the specialty of information technologies within
    of [my university degree at UPC](https://www.fib.upc.edu/ca/estudis/graus/grau-en-enginyeria-informatica/pla-destudis/especialitats/tecnologies-de-la-informacio), 
    which broadly focuses on these fields. In the close future my goal is to get the [Comptia Security+](https://www.comptia.org/es/certificaciones/security)
    and [Comptia Pentest+](https://www.comptia.org/es/certificaciones/pentest) certs and acquire professional experience in 
    the cybersecurity field (preferably pentesting).
    If you’re interested in someone with my skill-set, or would like to discuss something tech related feel free to reach out.
    I’d love to talk.
