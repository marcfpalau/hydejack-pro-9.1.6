Hello there! My name is Marc, and I am passionate about cybersecurity, networks and pentesting. I love the challenge of finding vulnerabilities and exploiting them to improve security, there's 
nothing quite like the feeling of successfully breaking into a system.

I created this website to share my knowledge and experiences with the wider community. I believe that cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field, and that we all have something to learn from each other. 
Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, my hope is that you'll find something useful here.

So if you're interested in cybersecurity, pentesting, or just want to chat about all things tech, feel free to drop me a line.

Thanks for stopping by, and happy hacking!
